# Notes
This is a private repository providing reference to evaluation on 
Yibo Liu's application for PhD Research Fellow in Modelling of 
future renewable energy systems with sustainable batteries at 
University of Oslo. All files in this repository should not be
used for other purpose.


The python files are main files for the python lab mentioned in 
cover letter. The four files serve for the same project.
Topics of the files are stated in commit separately.

The GAMS file is about one of the scenarios I am studying on for 
master thesis. 

Warmly welcome for any further suggestions, discussions and questions!
